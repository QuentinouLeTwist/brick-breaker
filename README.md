# Known issues
- *While increasing the vertical velocity of the ball, that ball has a kind of choppy effect. It's like a framerate issue (well, in my opinion), even if the FPS is close to 60 though. Still need to investigate this.* **seems not happening on all devices, only on my development laptop**
- Sometimes, when the ball is colisionning the paddle, it is not visually colisionning it, it's like the colision happens a bit above the paddle. It's not everytime though. Still need to investigate this.
